This is a free "DLC" for your BlueLight server!
-------------------------------------------------

Do you always have the problem, if you want to transfer a player via the console but the console says: You must use this command in-game!
Here is the solution!
All you have to do is:
Go to the src of BlueLight
Then in PocketMine
Then Commands
Then defaults
And then you just have to replace the TransferCommand.php with that in the BlueLight version!
Have fun ;)
